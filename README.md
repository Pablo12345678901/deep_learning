This is a repo to practice deep learning in Python with projets linked to the book "deep learning, practical recipes to get started quickly", Douwe Osinga, O'reilly, 2018.

The main repo contains :

- a "dev_and_tests_from_deep_learning_cookbook_examples" dir : a clone of the official book documentation code in order to process tests of existing functionality and development of new functionality.

- a "sound_anticipation" dir : a real AI project (paused for later development) - read the README.md file inside to get a quick understanding of the target
