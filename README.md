# deep_learning

This is a repo to practice deep learning in Python with projets linked to the book "deep learning, practical recipes to get started quickly", Douwe Osinga, O'reilly, 2018.

The main repo contains :
- "deep_learning_cookbook" : the official book documentation (script, notebooks, ...) as a submodule
- "dev_et_tests" : a clone of the official book documentation in order to process tests and possibly crash without tempering the REAL official book documentation
- "diverses_ressources_crees_par_moi" : my scripts (bash, python, ...)
- "fichiers_pr_test" : files used for testing the scripts
